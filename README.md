# Baby Names Analyzer
The Baby Names Analyzer is a Java project developed by Vaishali Vyas. This project facilitates the analysis of U.S. baby name trends from 1880 to 2014. It includes a variety of features such as ranking names, determining name equivalency across different years, and providing birth statistics. The project can perform both comprehensive analyses on full datasets and simplified testing using shorter datasets.

## Overview
This repository contains my project submission for the "Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software" course, part of the Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization offered by Duke University on Coursera. The course can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming).

The assignment involves processing and analyzing large sets of data regarding baby names in the United States. The project is based on concepts and techniques learned during the course, focusing on Java programming fundamentals.

## Assignment Details
The assignment requires writing a Java program to analyze baby name data from the United States, ranging from 1880 to 2014. The program involves various methods to manipulate and interpret the data, addressing specific questions related to the dataset.

## Key Functionalities:
- Calculate total births, along with the breakdown of boys' and girls' names.
- Determine the rank of a given name based on the number of births in a particular year.
- Identify a name corresponding to a specific rank and gender in a given year.
- Analyze naming trends over the years and predict names based on their popularity.
- Calculate average ranking and total births ranked higher for specific names.

## Data Source
The data for this project is provided by the course instructors and is accessible on the course's website: [DukeLearnToProgram](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course2/index.php).

## Usage
To use the Baby Names Analyzer, create an instance of the BabyNames class and call the desired method. For example:
```
BabyNames analyzer = new BabyNames();
analyzer.printNames();
```
